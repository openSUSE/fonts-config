* 59-family-prefer-lang:
  + Google Noto embeds Adobe Source Sans Pro as Latin.
    but Google wants us to use Roboto/Noto Sans for Latin.
    the CJK prepend needs to prepend Roboto/Noto Sans/Serif
    too ✓
  + Adobe Source Sans Pro are smaller than Noto Sans, need
    to resize
* Noto Sans CJK SC and Noto Sans SC are different font names
  (The later is a subset of the former). So we need to provide
  substitutes. ✓
* Adobe Souce Hans are the same as Google Noto Sans. we need
  to use Noto to provide Source Hans
* openSUSE should support colored emojis out of the box.
  + "emoji" family has been defined by fontconfig. ✓
  + "Symbola" conflicts with color emoji. need to replace it
    completely ✓
  + "Dejavu" contains black and white and ugly emojis, need
    to strip them. (All fonts are recognized as sans-serif
    if not explicitly assigned, we can't prepend "emoji" to
    "sans-serif" (boo#1092737), so we have to make sure every
    font appeared before Noto Color Emoji are emoji-less)
  + Firefox embeded a "EmojiOne Mozilla" font, which is black
    and white, we need to reject it. ✓
  + We may need to unset hint/antialias for emoji fonts.
* openSUSE should use modern symbol fonts like Deepin OpenSymbol
  which is 100% replacement for M$ Wingdings and Symbola ✓
  + packaging of deepin-opensymbol-fonts ✓
  + fontconfig substitutions ✓
* We need to re-evaluate the selections in 60-family-prefer.conf
  specially the CJK part. Most of the fonts listed there are
  pretty old and have modern replacement.
* We need to evaluate Noto fonts and add them to TT/Non-TT Instucted
